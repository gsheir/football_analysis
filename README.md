# Football data analysis

## Environment setup
This repo uses `pip-compile` to maintain an up-to-date requirements file. In your environment of choice (I use `virtualenv`), download pip-tools:

```
pip install pip-tools
```

and run

```
pip-compile requirements.in
```

to generate the `requirements.txt` file. You can then use 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

to install the prerequisites.
